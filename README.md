Django-Login-with-EmailConfirmation


**SuperUser ID & PASSWORD:**

ID: django

Password: django123

Email Confirmation is integrated with the latest Google Security Policy.

If you want to run this code, you need to replace the email and password with your own.

How to add a new EMAIL AND PASSWORD:

**Step 1:** Go to your email account settings, and click on "Security". Make sure to turn on two-factor authentication if it's not already enabled.

**Step 2:** After enabling two-factor authentication, search for "APP PASSWORD" in the security settings. Add a project name, and it will generate a password. Make sure to copy this password.

**Step 3:** Open the code in your code editor and go to the info.py file. Replace the existing email and password with the ones you copied.

**Step 4:** Now, run the code using the following command in the command prompt:
py manage.py runserver

I hope this helps!!!
